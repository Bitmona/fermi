13
‚ÄúBad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price. You know that I bought it (oh yeah, you're right, I want it)‚Äù Let‚Äôs pretend that all of the streams for Taylor Swift‚Äôs ‚ÄúCruel Summer‚Äù on Spotify are unique (although we all know that‚Äôs not true. I make up like... at least 100 of them...). Suppose all of those people bought tickets for the Eras Tour at the resale price averaged from all venues. How many ‚ÄúIt's a Cruel Summer with You‚Äù crewneck sweaters could be bought with the money instead?
10
‚ÄúGot a long list of ex-lovers. They'll tell you I'm insane‚Äù I typed out a list of my competition... I mean... every person that Taylor Swift has ever dated.

‚ÄúYou know I love a London boy. I enjoy walking SoHo, drinking in the afternoon (yeah)‚Äù Despite the long distance, luckily Swift is an international pop star.

Airport in New York City, USA to London-Heathrow Airport in London, England, funding them solely with the royalties she was paid by Spotify in All air travel was done in her private jet, a Dassault Falcon Once she runs out of money, she stops.

‚ÄúAll along there was some invisible string tying you to me?‚Äù Let‚Äôs say there really was an invisible string, tying Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift together (if they‚Äôre not together when you guys are taking this test I‚Äôm actually gonna be so mad bc I‚Äôm writing this in December rn üíÄ). Suppose they‚Äôre each at their hometowns currently, with Kelce being from Westlake, OH and Swift from West Reading, PA. How many times could this supposed ‚Äúinvisible string‚Äù from this situation wrap around a standard American football?
6
Although this test writer is currently attending UC Berkeley in the San Francisco Bay Area (which is like... at least two football fields away), and cannot be there in person to see all of you amazing people, if I were to steal a Bugatti Chiron Super Sport 300+ and race down the I-5, continuously maintaining top speed and with complete disregard for all traffic laws, how many centuries would it take me to get to UC Riverside?
-6
The ‚Äúone-percenter‚Äù claim refers to the idea that while 99% of motorcyclists are law-abiding, there is a 1% minority that are outlaws.

The Cannonball Run is an unofficial (and illegal, in theory) speed challenge where one attempts to cross the country as fast as possible in any automobile, going from New York City to Los Angeles. Suppose I was doing the Run starting in LA, and I had a California Highway Patrol officer in a standard police-issue Ford Explorer Interceptor pursuing me the entire time. We both magically have unlimited gas and do not have to stop. In US Dollars, how much would it cost the state of California to have this officer maintain his pursuit, from LA, until I finally finish the run and pull over to receive my speeding ticket in NYC?

17
What is (e^pi)^(phi^lambda)^(A^K)?
4
What is 11162005 x 2172024?
13
If every human on Earth suddenly became the size of the Colossus of Rhodes, then how many pounds of carbon dioxide would we produce daily?
11
Although this affliction upon humanity magically repaired itself, for some reason, I am now the only colossal human left standing. Time to cause some mayhem! If I tore down the Great Pyramid of Giza, how many Stonehenge‚Äôs could I build with the rubble?
3
Seeing as China isn‚Äôt really under any more threat of invasion by ruthless Hun hordes, I suppose it‚Äôs fine to ‚Äúrepurpose‚Äù the Great Wall of China. If I tore it down, how many Lighthouses of Alexandria‚Äôs could I build with the rubble?
5
Did you all know that destroying ancient monuments is a war crime? I didn‚Äôt. In a symbolic gesture, the Hague has set the venue of my trial to be one of the last Wonders of the World left standing after my rampage‚Äî the Colosseum. However.. It‚Äôs a ruin‚Äîhardly a setting worthy of the International Criminal Court. How many cubic meters of stone would be needed to restore it to its former glory?

I escaped custody and am now hiding in one of the Wonders of the Industrial World: the London sewer system. On an average year, how many tons of sewage passes through the system?
7
INTERPOL got a hot tip on my location and are now chasing me through Britain (I bet those sewer rats that I befriended... ratted me out). Somehow, they managed to reverse my colossal-ness, but I gained super speed (like... Usain Bolt-level speed) in the process. To make things interesting, I‚Äôm fleeing through the Channel Tunnel, one of the Wonders of the Modern World, hopefully to find refuge in France. How many years would it take for me to run from the British side of the tunnel, to the French side?
-4
Fun fact: The Eiffel Tower in Paris, France was considered for a contest naming the new Seven Wonders of the World, but it was not ultimately selected. The vengeful spirit of the Tower now seeks to team up with me to take revenge upon the world. If I managed to somehow abscond with the entire structure, and bring it with me into outer space, then how many Newtons of energy would be released upon the Earth from the kinetic force of me launching the Tower from the Moon?
