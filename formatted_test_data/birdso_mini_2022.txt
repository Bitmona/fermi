In thermodynamics, Boltzmann–Planck equation describes the relationship between entropy and the total number of microstates in the macrostate of an ideal gas. It is given as the equation: S = KB ln(W) where KB is the Boltzmann constant. (Boltzmann’s constant is also equivalent to the ideal gas constant / Avogadro’s constant) Let n = number of molecules present and e = total energy, where the energy of a molecule is at least In a system where n = 2 and e = 4, W is found to be Similarly, in a system where n = 4 and e = 8, W is found to be Find the entropy of a system in J/K where n = 1024 and e = 2 × 1024

Given Information: 1 Planck Temperature = 1.416784×1032 K 1 Planck Length = 1.616255×10−35 m 1 Planck Mass = 2.176434×10−8 Kg 1 Planck Time = 5.391247 × 10−44 s The R-value is a measure of how well a 2-D barrier can resist the conductivity of heat. The SI units for R-value is Kelvin meters squared per Watt, where the units for Watts are kilogram meters squared per seconds cubed. Convert 1 R-value to Planck R-value, where Planck R-value is the R-value expressed in Planck units.
