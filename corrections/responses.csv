Probability of 72 ties in a row: This is simply the probability of a tie happening on each round 72 times, so it's (1/9)^72.
Probability of any non-tie outcome: Once we have 72 ties, the next round must break the tie and therefore not be a tie. This means the probability of any non-tie outcome is 1 - (probability of a tie) = 1 - 1/9 = 8/9.

Given that wattage is equal to amperage times voltage, at a standard US voltage of 120, that means there's half an amp running through a 60 watt bulb. 6e18 electrons divided by 0.5 amps is a 1.2e19. Likewise, if we use a more global voltage of 240 volts, that would mean a quarter of an amp is running through a 60 watt bulb. 6e18 electrons divided by 0.25 amps is 2.4e19, which would also be 19.
