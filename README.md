## Updates

### Inital Release (May 26, 2023)
Hey everyone, I'm Andy, a graduating senior from Seven Lakes. Earlier in the year, I made this tool to study for fermi and it helped us get 2nd at MIT. I wanted to release it for all of yall after adding in all the public test sets. Everything is open source, including the ~1200 questions dataset, so feel free to use this tool as you like. The user interface is designed to be simple and mobile-friendly, and overall convenient since everything's in one place. I'll still be developing and adding more features so any suggestions are welcome. Hope you enjoy!
