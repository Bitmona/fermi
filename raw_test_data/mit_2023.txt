51. Let's start with some unit conversions. Not too bad right? An Henry
(units) is a measurement of electrical inductance with SI units of
(kg)(m)^2(s)^-2(A)^-2. Convert one Henry to units of (solar masses)(astronomical
units)^2(years)^-2(nanoamperes)^-2
52. At the time of writing this question, it's almost Christmas, which means
gift wrapping! If I take a point and continue to wrap layers of .1 mm thick
wrapping paper around, how many layers would be needed for the layered
wrapping papers to collapse into a black hole? Presume perfect wrapping and
that any resulting sphere has the density of wrapping paper.
53. What is primorial(30)? A primorial is when for the nth prime number, the
primorial is defined as the product of the first n primes.

places a pair of pennies per pico-pineapple picked perfectly planar what
percent of Peru (by surface area) can Peter Piper pack?

58. Bitcoin mining can get quite energy intensive. In his quest to mine
bitcoins, Aidan has come up with a brilliant idea: he develops the Potential
Energy Collecting Setup (PECS) that can collect gravitational potential energy
of a falling object and transform 100% of that energy into mining bitcoins. If
Aidan places PECS in his room and jumps up and down, where PECS collects
Aidan's gravitational potential energy at each peak of his jump, how many
times must Aidan jump to mine one Bitcoin?
