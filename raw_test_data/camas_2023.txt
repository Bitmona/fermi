across the US on an average Saturday? [kernels]
25. Objects like the International Space Station travel about 100 miles above the

right?
Note: there are 158 total questions, each with 5 choices.
29. Suppose you wanted to send a radio message to the nearest exoplanet 4

40. Estimate the rate at which electric charge flows through wires when someone
charges their cell phone. [electron charge / second]
41. In the Incredibles universe, Frozone frequently
creates ice bridges to slide across. (See figure
at right.) To create the ice bridge, energy must
be absorbed from the water vapor in the air so
that it condenses and then freezes. Since we
don’t see Frozone’s surroundings heat up
when he uses his powers, let’s suppose that
he absorbs that energy.
Imagine he absorbs the energy from his surroundings to create an ice bridge 30 m
long. How many single-serving bags of Doritos would he have to eat to gain the
equivalent amount of energy?
42. In the Incredibles universe, Elastigirl is able to stretch
to remarkable lengths. One possible mechanism
might be that Elastigirl rearranges her cells rather than
changing the volume of her cells. In that scenario,
estimate the circumference of her upper arm (i.e., her
biceps + triceps) [cm] if she stretches her arm to 10 m.
43. How much banana is too much banana?
Bananas contain significantly high potassium concentrations. Potassium is an
essential element for life as we know it. Among other things, it facilitates the
normal transmission of signals through the nervous system. But, in nature, about
0.012% of potassium is the radioactive isotope potassium-40. Thus, the
potassium-40 (K-40) in a single banana exposes a person to about 100 nSv (also
known as a banana equivalent dose or BED). A lethal dose of radiation for 50% of
people in 30 days (LD50/30) is about 5,000 mSv.
Estimate the volume of bananas required to provide a lethal exposure to K-40.
[classrooms]
44. Estimate how much helium you would need to float away on a lawn chair.
[birthday balloons]
45. You see color because the cones in your retina interact with certain wavelengths
of light (420 - 720 nm). If you had the same number of cones but could see the
energy from a radio tower antenna transmitting at 92.5 MHz, what would the
radius of your eyes be? [cm]
46. In the Marvel universe, Thor sometimes pounds his
magical war hammer on the ground to create a shock
wave to knock his opponents down. If his foes are 6 m
away, estimate the pressure at the point of contact
between the hammer and the ground. [atm]
For the sake of this estimate, assume his foes are
humanoid and have human mass.
47. If you walked at a snail’s pace in an approximately straight line, estimate how long
it would take to travel from Camas to the top of Mt. Rainier. [hrs]
48. Estimate the amount of energy it takes to smile. [J]
