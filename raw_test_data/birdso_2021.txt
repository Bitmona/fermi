trees are needed to power the entire Western Interconnection?
53. Cellulose is an extremely strong polymer. A rod of pure cellulose is fabricated with a length of 2 m and
a diameter of 5 cm. If a compressive force of 7 kN is applied to its ends, how much does it contract by,
in meters?
54. In a different universe, the speed of light is ten thousand times greater than the speed of light. With
everything else staying the same, what is the Planck length of the other universe, in meters (from this
universe)?

56. According to the holographic principle, the maximum amount of information (in bits) that can be
stored in a system is proportional to the surface area. Hawking found that the maximum entropy (or
information) can be found by S = kA/4, where k is the Boltzmann’s constant (1.3 × 10−23 JK) and A is
the surface area in Planck areas. Using this equation, how many times more information can a human
body theoretically hold than the human body already holds through the storage of DNA? Assume there
are 40 trillion human cells that contain DNA.

current population of the earth give off in 1 galactic year?

hole, c is the speed of light, and r is the radius of the black hole. Calculate the volume in liters of a
perfect sphere of water so that there is just enough water to form a black hole. Assume that the density
stays constant.
59. A dumb hole (or a sonic black hole) is a type of black hole where phonons rather than photons are
unable to escape. After expanding/compressing the universe’s radius to create a dumb hole, what is
the radius of the new universe (in meters)? Take into account baryonic matter, dark matter, and dark
energy. Assume the dumb hole to be surrounded by dry air at 20 degrees Celcius.
