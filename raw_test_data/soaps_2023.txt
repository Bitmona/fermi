bubble pressure waves?
52. Assume you are sound designing using an FM synthesizer to generate imperfect intervals, in relation to an

to Olympia, Washington State. If we assume the Earth is a perfect sphere, and use the airplane direct flight
distance between the two cities as the arc distance, we will notice that the tunnel forms a "chord" in this perfect
sphere Earth. Given these simplifications, in kelvin, how much hotter is the hottest temperature that the
environment surrounding the tunnel underground will reach, due to the geothermal gradient, compared to the
surface? (Use average geothermal gradient for the US)


59.
Problems 59 and 60 use the same context in a hypothetical universe.
After enduring "down in Ohio" jokes for an eternity, residents of Ohio (Ohioans) have planned their revenge: taking
over the United States. Ohioans are evenly distributed among the 49 defending US states (you may neglect the
remainder), forming 49 different corps (enumerated 1st through 49th). Each corp has the same fixed number of
brigades. EACH brigade contains 1,000 Ohioans. Each corp battles a different state, and the brigades of each corp
attack the corresponding state independently. Brigades either win or lose an attack and each have the same percent
chance of victory in an independent attack as the percent of the world's population that the Mongol invasions
allegedly killed. (Assume that the population of Ohio in 2021.)

(Case 1:) Ohio begins by testing the brigades of its 37th corp on just one state: Indiana. If the conquest of
Indiana fails, Ohio will cease to be a menace to the rest of the US, compromising Ohio's war strategies. *** In
the battle of Indiana, AT LEAST ONE of the 37th corp's brigades must win an attack for Ohio's success in
defeating Indiana. What is the percent chance that Ohio is unsuccessful in the battle of Indiana? (Hint: the
chance is very small.)

60.
Problems 59 and 60 use the same context in a hypothetical universe.
After enduring "down in Ohio" jokes for an eternity, residents of Ohio (Ohioans) have planned their revenge: taking
over the United States. Ohioans are evenly distributed among the 49 defending US states (you may neglect the

brigades. EACH brigade contains 1,000 Ohioans. Each corp battles a different state, and the brigades of each corp
attack the corresponding state independently. Brigades either win or lose an attack and each have the same percent
chance of victory in an independent attack as the percent of the world's population that the Mongol invasions
allegedly killed. (Assume that the population of Ohio in 2021.)

(Case 2:) A surprise coup d'etat in the governance of Ohio prior to the battle of Indiana causes a change of
plans in Ohio's war strategies. Now, Ohio will swiftly engage in a battle with all 49 defending states at once,
instead of just Indiana. Additionally, Ohio has realized that to secure stable control over the states once the war
has ended, AT LEAST HALF the brigades of each corp must survive and win their independent attacks on
their corresponding states. What is the percent chance that Ohio is unsuccessful in conquering the United
States if at least half of the brigades of each corp must win their independent attacks? (Note: corps also battle
each state independently, and must either win or lose each battle. Ohio prevails in conquering the US if every
corp succeeds against every state--particularly when at least half of each of their brigades prevail.)
