1. Assuming the US average, how many grams of food will be wasted today
by all Science Olympiad competitors?

2. If all competitors chose to work a Massachusetts minimum wage job
instead of competing in this tournament (8 hour work day), how many
Bitcoins could you make instead (1 Bitcoin ~ $13200 at time of writing)?

3. During the course of this event, how many tons of carbon dioxide will you
have emitted by breathing?

4. About 2*10^38

neutrinos are created in the Sun every second. Assuming
they radiate out of the Sun uniformly, how many solar neutrinos will go
through you during this event?

5. If all Fermi competitors chewed gum during their block, how much energy,
in Btu (British thermal units), would be collectively spent doing so?

6. During the course of this event, how much less will a dollar be worth due
to inflation (in dollars)? Assume a linear decrease in value.

7. How many times will your heart beat during the course of this event?

8. Assuming the US average, how many seconds will all competitors
collectively spend on their phones today?

9. Assuming 1 byte is needed per character to store this test digitally, how
many bits are needed for the whole test? Assume only text counts towards
this, aka the XKCD in front counts as 0 bits.

10. How many dead skin cells will have been shed by Fermi competitors in
this room today (gross)?

12. How many trees (or fractions of trees) have been cut down to produce all
the paper needed for tests in this event?

13. Assume the Earth is made entirely of water. How many seconds would it
take for the Sun to increase the Earth’s temperature by 1oC? Assume 100% of
the input energy is used to heat up the Earth (no loss in energy to reflection,
atmospheric effects, etc).

14. How many iPhone X’s could we power with this amount of energy?

15. Compared to all humans who have ever existed, what fraction of them are
competing in today’s tournament?

16. If we wanted to power all MIT buildings using just AAA batteries today,
how many would we need?

17. We want to be really energetic for our tests, so to get maximum value we
decide to eat uranium instead of food for energy. How much more
energy-dense is uranium than carbohydrates per kilogram (fission of uranium
vs. combustion of carbohydrates)?

18. Assuming an average distance of 1 foot between your center of mass and
this test, what is the gravitational force between you in Newtons?

19. During the course of this event, how much money will Google have
made?

20. Suppose you eat pizza today for lunch. If you put the equivalent of one
Jalapeño pepper’s worth of red pepper on your pizza, how many pizzas would
you need to consume to eat one Carolina Reaper’s worth of Scoville units?
Assume Scoville units are additive.

21. During the course of this event, how much energy could one typical solar
panel produce in Joules? Assume these are photovoltaic, 65” x 39”, and are
the ones typically used for powering homes.

22. During the course of this event, how many neural spikes will you have
had, assuming high brain activity?

23. Suppose we can fit at most 72 teams at MIT due to its surface area. How
many teams could the Pacific Ocean fit, surface-area wise?

24. How many dollar bills would it take to fill the Great Dome of MIT?
Assume the walls are thin and the inside completely hollow, and that the
dome is a perfect hemisphere. Ignore any packing effects.

25. How far will the Jakobshavn Isbrae, the fastest glacier in the world, travel
during the course of this event in millimeters?

26. Assume each competitor spends 1 hour today scrolling through Facebook
on their phone. Assuming about 1 post per screen size, a 5” screen
(vertically), and about 5 seconds per post, how many miles of Facebook will
competitors collectively scroll through?

27. If all competitors put a three minute song on Spotify and play it
continuously 24 hrs today, how much money would we make in dollars?

28. What percent of the annual US cotton production goes into making MIT
Science Olympiad shirts? Assume we make one for each competitor, and that
shirts are 100% cotton.

29. Time for some major 2017 events. The neutron star collision detected by
LIGO produced about 200 Earth masses of gold. Assuming 1 kg of gold is
worth $1200, how many times greater value did this produce than the current
US national debt?

30. The US was hit by three major hurricanes in 2017 - Harvey, Irma, and
Maria. In dollars, what is the estimated total damage from these hurricanes?

Assuming the highest energy estimate, how many Joules of energy did this
explosion release?

33. One of the biggest controversies of 2017 was the active involvement of
Russia in sabotaging the U.S. election. How much more money (aka a factor)
was spent by Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump on Facebook advertisements
